# ðŸš€ Credit Card Fraud Detection
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and optimization to improve fraud detection accuracy.

 # ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains anonymized credit card transactions with labeled instances:
0 â†’ Legitimate Transaction
1 â†’ Fraudulent Transaction
Features are numerical and transformed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
The dataset is highly imbalanced, requiring resampling techniques.

# ðŸ”§ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
NumPy, Pandas â†’ Data Processing
Matplotlib, Seaborn â†’ Visualization
Scikit-Learn â†’ Machine Learning Models
Imbalanced-Learn â†’ Handling Class Imbalance
TensorFlow/Keras (optional) â†’ Deep Learning

 # ðŸ“Š Project Workflow
Data Preprocessing
Load and clean data
Handle missing values (if any)
Address class imbalance using SMOTE / Undersampling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze fraud vs. non-fraud transaction patterns
Feature correlation and visualization
Model Selection & Training
Machine Learning Models:
Logistic Regression
Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy, Precision, 
Confusion Matrix for performance analysis
Model Optimization
